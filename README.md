# MastodonTestApp

This is merely an experimental test zone for me to learn ways to work with the Mastodon API.

All configuration is done via environment variables. They are as follows:

* MASTODON_SERVER
  * Please include `https://`
* MASTODON_EMAIL
* MASTODON_PASSWORD
* CLIENT_ID
* CLIENT_SECRET
* DEBUG_ENABLED
  * Default is `false`. This will print sensitive info to the console.

Personally I would advise against running this, as I cannot say what it will do at any given moment - as stated previously, it is a workbench of sorts. Anything could happen.
